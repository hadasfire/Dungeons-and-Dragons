# Dungeons-and-Dragons

A multi-level single player version of Dungeons and Dragons board play.

Maintained adherence to object-oriented programming principles and coding conventions, implemented Unit Tests as an integral part of the development workflow.

The project was made on my First year in Ben Gurion University as a student in "OOP" course.

# Instructions
The game is played on a board. The game board consists of a player, enemies of different types, walls, and empty areas that both players and enemies can walkthrough.

In this board, the symbol @ in green represents the player while the later red symbols B, s, k and M represent the enemies that the player should fight. In addition, there are dots scattered along the paths, representing
the free areas, and # symbols that represent the walls. 

The game takes a path to a directory containing indexed files via the command line argument. Each file represents a game level.

In this version of the game, there are three types of players which differ in the abilities they have and two types of enemies: monster and traps. The user controls the player using the
keyboard and the computer controls the monsters.
