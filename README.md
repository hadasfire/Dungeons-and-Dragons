# Dungeons-and-Dragons

A multi-level single player version of Dungeons and Dragons board play.
Maintained adherence to object-oriented programming principles and coding conventions, implemented Unit Tests as an integral part of the development workflow.
The project was made on my First year in Ben Gurion University as a student in "OOP" course.
